        <h1>Assignment 2.2 – Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2</h1>
        <h2>introducing myself</h2>
        <p class="intro">I was born and raised in a small town in FL. Growing up, I enjoyed exploring the outdoors which has followed me into adulthood. My family and I spent a good amount of time outdoors for camping.</p>
        <p>One of my favorite hobbies is gaming and anything that has to do with creating. I enjoy crafting things that can be used in day-to-day life along with gifting them to others. I have grown to love gardening since this allows me to become more self-reliant.</p>
        <p>In addition to my hobbies, I am passionate about technology and programming. I spend my free time learning new programming languages and working on personal coding projects. This passion led me to pursue a career in computer science, more so in software engineering/development.</p>
        <p>I am hoping to further achieve my goals as a coder but I still have my plan B which is the medical (or rather, biology) field.</p>
